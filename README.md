## Overview

The project aimed to develop the homepage of the Rentiz website based on a moderately complex design layout.

### The challenge

The main challenge was to create functional and responsive sliders and a gallery.
This project aimed to assess and showcase my layout skills, with a focus on creating a fully responsive website using different technologies, including CSS Grid. Additionally, the project required basic JavaScript skills.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the sliders using either their mouse or touchpad

## My process

1. Set up a basic HTML file with the necessary structure.

2. Successfully set up and configured Gulp in order to compile my SASS code into CSS and assist me with various tasks throughout the development process.

3. Wrote the CSS styles using SASS, which is a CSS preprocessor that makes it easier to write complex stylesheets. SASS allows you to use variables, mixins, and functions, which can simplify the process of writing CSS.

4. Used BEM methodology to structure the CSS. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and is a naming convention for CSS classes that makes it easier to manage and scale large CSS projects. BEM encourages the use of modular, reusable code and helps to avoid specificity issues.

5. Utilized both CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a layout.

6. Used SwiperJS to create two sliders and the image gallery that automatically changes images.

7. Tested the page to make sure it displays correctly in different browsers and devices.

### What I learned
